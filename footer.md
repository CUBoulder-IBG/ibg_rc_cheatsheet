# Modifying this README

Do not directly modify this document directly. Instead modify `ibg_rc_cheatsheet.md` and run `compile.sh` to add TOC and create printable version. This will also update the README displayed on github. You might need to make `gh-md-toc` executable via `chmod a+x gh-md-toc` and you definitely will need to install pandoc. TOC generation powered by [github-markdown-toc](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc)
